You O
have O
put O
quite O
a O
new O
pleasure O
for O
me O
into O
hearing O
the O
sheep O
bleat O
on O
the O
hills O
- O
every O
now O
and O
then O
it O
puts O
me O
so O
completely O
in O
mind O
of O
the O
dear O
little O
pitiful O
ones O
, O
bleats O
at O
home O
ending O
with O
the O
comfortable O
short O
one!. O

a O
fine O
long O
day O

high O
summits O

though O
I O

only O
to O
go O
down O

all O
in O
perfect O
peace O

Among O

men O
were O
the O
brothers O
Dodgson B-PER
- O
who O
were O
so O
intent O
on O
thier O
woodcutting O
that O
they O
devoted O
Sunday O
to O
cooking O
for O
the O
whole O
week O
. O

When O
they O
were O
growing O
old O
, O
they O
found O
the O
need O
of O
some O
domestic O
help O
and O
comfort O
- O
and O
at O
last O
, O
the O
one O
relieved O
his O
mind O
to O
the O
other O
saying O
" O
Thou O
mun O
out O

an O
tait O

" O
Aye O

" O

the O

" O
