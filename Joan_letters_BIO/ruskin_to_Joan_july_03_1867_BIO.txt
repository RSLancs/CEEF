I O
have O
just O
got O
your O
hurried O
line O
as O
you O
were O
leaving O

I O
hope O
mine O
yesterday O
would O
put O
you O
at O
rest O
- O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
Keswick B-LOC
, O
where O
please O
direct O

I O
can O
easily O
leave O
Crawley B-PER
behind O
me O
- O
but O
I O
think O
I O
should O
perhaps O
put O
you O
all O
too O
much O
out O
of O
your O
way O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
bustle O
- O
however O
I O
've O
time O
to O
think O
about O
it O
now O
- O
