though O
the O
simile O

It O
was O
half O
past O
eleven O
before O
we O
started O

it O
is O
a O
half O

walk O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O

                     O
hill O
. O

I O
took O
care O
of O
Downes B-PER
half O
way O
up O
and O
gave O
him O
two O
rests O
and O
then O

                     O
went O
on O
myself O
, O
and O
got O
up O
by O
ten O
minutes O
past O
two O
- O
it O
is O
nice O
being O
alone O
on O
Skiddaw B-LOC
top O
, O
the O
air O
was O
quite O
soft O
, O
though O
fresh O
, O
and O
it O
has O
the O

                     O
widest O
view O
of O
all O
the O

and O
the O
sea O
of O
hills O
, O

                     O
southward O
being O
much O
finer O
than O
from O
Saddleback B-LOC
but O
the O
mountain O

                     O
itself O
far O
inferior O
. O

                 O

I O
am O
really O
afraid O
of O
getting O
interested O
in O
anything O
- O
lest O
I O

                     O
should O
be O
tempted O
to O
work O
of O
any O
kind O
- O
so O
I O
just O
walked O
to O
and O
fro O
on O
the O
top O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hourlittle O

                         O
while O
- O
and O
then O
ran O
down O
again O

It O
is O
soft O
ground O
or O
shale O
all O
the O
way O
and O
nothing O
to O
be O
taken O
care O
of O
- O
except O
here O

                     O
& O
there O
a O
heather O
tuft O
; O
so O
I O
was O
able O
to O
go O
with O
free O
speed O
- O
and O
I O
came O
down O
in O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
quarter O
, O
leaping O
the O
fence O
from O

                     O
the O
moor O
into O
the O
turnpike O
road O
at O
the O
bottom O
at O
three O
minutes O
short O
of O
the O
half O
hour O
past O
three O

                 O
- O
and O
I O
could O
have O
done O
it O
in O
an O
hour O
, O
easily O
, O
on O
a O
cool O
day O
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
hot O
near O
the O
bottom O
on O

                 O
the O
south O
slope O

I O
did O
the O
bit O
of O
turnpike O
road O
satisfactorily O
- O
though O
it O
was O

                     O
hot O
, O
and O
got O
into O
my O
room O
and O
fairly O
for O
dinner O

                     O
before O
the O
clock O
struck O
four O

So O
I O
'm O
quite O
satisfied O
now O
that O

I O

Post O

I O
had O
another O
lovely O
sunset O
on O
the O
lake O
after O
dinner O
- O
at O
my O
favourite O
island O
-- O
there O

                     O
was O
some O
hay O
fresh O
cut O
in O
the O
fields O
above O
the O
rocky O

                     O
lake O
shore O
, O
and O
just O
above O
the O
rocks O
, O
there O
is O
a O
fringe O
of O

                     O
beautiful O
trees O
; O
- O
separating O
the O
fields O
from O
the O
lake O
; O

                 O
the O
sun O
was O
setting O
behind O
the O
hayfields O
, O
and O
making O
them O
like O
heaps O
of O
gold O
, O
seen O
through O
the O

                     O
branches O
of O
the O
wild O
trees O
; O
then O
glancing O
down O
across O
the O
water O
to O
my O
island O
and O
shining O
through O

                 O
the O
heather O
- O
on O
that O
- O
and O
at O
last O
just O
a O
little O
into O
my O
eyes O
as O
I O
lay O
half O
asleep O
, O

                     O
half O
looking O
at O
it O
, O
just O
to O
let O
it O
have O
the O
finer O
charm O
of O
dreamland O

I O
lost O
the O
lock O
of O
my O
boatchain O
among O
the O
heather B-FLO

I O
did O
not O

                     O
notice O
it O

so O
sleepy O
I O
was O
