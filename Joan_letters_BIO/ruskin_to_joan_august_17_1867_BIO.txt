I O
'm O
so O
glad O
my O
letters O
have O
made O
you O
happy O

I O
did O
write O
them O
carefully O
, O
thinking O
of O
what O
my O
itie O
' O
amie O
was O

                     O
feeling O
, O
( O
and O
I O
know O
, O
pretty O
well O
. O
) O

But O
they O
're O
all O
true O
- O
though O
I O
chose O
among O
true O
things O
, O
what O
I O
thought O
would O
comfort O

                     O
itie O
' O
amie O
the O
most O
. O

You O
would O
hardly O
think O
it O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
very O
uncomfortable O
myself O
, O
with O
losing O
count O
of O
my O

                     O
days O
, O
- O
the O
new O
1 O
. O
2 O
. O
3 O
seems O
to O
go O
on O
so O
dedful O
slow O

I O
was O
very O
miserable O
yesterday O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
tell O
why O
, O
but O
nothing O
gave O
me O
the O
least O

                     O
pleasure O
. O

Today O
, O
it O
poured O
of O
rain O
all O
day O
long O

I O
had O
left O
some O
stones O
that O
I O
wanted O
on O
Skiddaw B-LOC
top O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
might O
as O
well O

                     O
go O
and O
fetch O
them O

I O
got O
a O
rough O
poney O
, O
and O
a O
little O
boy O
to O
ride O
him O
, O
between O
two O
saddlebags O
for O

                 O
the O
stones O
, O
and O
started O
at O
12 O
oclock O
, O
Crawley B-PER
& O
all O

- O
The O
rain O
got O
heavier O
every O
foot O
we O
mounted O
- O
and O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
shoulder O
of O
flat O

                     O
moor O
, O
under O
the O
summmit O
, O
the O
cloud O
was O
as O
thick O
as O
London B-LOC
fog O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O

                     O
go O
by O
my O
compass O

- O
I O
struck O
the O
path O
for O
the O
summit O
without O
an O
error O
of O
ten O
feet O
- O
after O
a O
mile O
's O
walking O
straight O
into O
the O
cloud O

The O
wind O
got O
fierce O
near O
the O
top O
, O
and O
the O
little O
boy O
- O
( O
- O
in O
a O
far O
away O
way O
he O
was O
like O

                     O
Rosie B-PER
)- I-PER
got O
rather O
frightened O
and O
cold O

I O
left O
him O
in O
as O
sheltered O
a O
place O
as O
I O
could O
find O
- O
with O
Crawley B-PER

                     O
to O
take O
care O
of O
him O
- O
& O
went O
on O
to O
the O
top O
myself O

- O
The O
rain O
was O
crashing O
among O
the O
shingle O
like O
a O
waterspout O
but O
the O
wind O
, O
strangely O

                     O
enough O
, O
lulled O
nearjust O
at O

                     O
the O
summmit O
- O
and O
I O
stopped O
a O
little O
which O
then O
- O
in O
my O
usual O
way O
- O
- O
I O
was O
wet O

                     O
through O
of O
course O
- O
all O
about O
the O
limbs O
, O
so O
i O
could O
kneel O
down O
on O
the O
stones O
without O
caring O

Then O
I O
dug O
up O
the O
stone O
I O
had O
hidden O

& O
came O
back O
to O
Crawley B-PER
and O
the O
boy O
- O
and O
found O
some O
more O
of O

                     O
my O
nests O
and O
filled O
my O
saddlebags O
, O
and O
braced O
up O
the O
little O
fellow O
between O
them O
, O
and O
cheered O
him O

                 O
up O
, O
too O
and O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
give O
him O
a O
suit O
of O
clothes O
tomorrow O
, O
and O

                     O
set O
off O
downwards O

I O
saw O
him O
safe O
enough O
across O
the O
moor O
into O
the O
regular O
horse O
path O
, O
and O
then O
left O
him O
to O

                     O
Crawley B-PER
and O
came O
down O
myself O
by O
a O
short O
cut O

It O
rained O
worse O
at O
the O
top O
than O
it O
had O
done O
at O
the O
bottom O
- O
and O
when O
I O
got O
down O
again O
- O

                 O
it O
rained O
at O
the O
bottom O
worst O
of O
all O
! O

I O
got O
home O
by O
1/2 O
past O
four O
- O
dined O
at O
5 O
and O
had O
nearly O
a O
pint O
of O
sherry O
- O
your O
boy O
a O
basin O
of O
hot O
soup O
, O
rich O
& O
fine O
now O
I O
've O
had O

                     O
tea O
too O
, O
and O
am O
very O
jolly O

What O
beasts O
we O
are O
! O

Yesterday O
doing O
nothing O
, O
& O
drinking O
little O
, O
in O

                     O
spite O
of O
all O
self O
- O
examination O
& O
lecturing O
and O
proper O
thinking O
- O
I O
was O
utterly O

                     O
wretched O
- O
today O
, O
I O
've O
had O
a O
wetting O
and O
a O
pint O
of O
sherry O
, O
& O
I O
'm O
all O
right O

Sunday O
morning O

18th O
Aug O

It O
's O
very O
odd O
, O
i O
always O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
after O
these O
wet O
days O
than O
after O
dry O
ones O

I O
'm O
as O
fresh O
as O
a O
daisy O
- O
this O
morning O

- O
Not O
much O
inclined O
ot O
go O
to O
church O
, O
though O
- O
- O
but O
I O
shall O
- O
and O
see O
what O
is O
said O
to O
me- O

For O
you O
and O
Auntie B-PER
have O
, O
I O
doubt O
not O
, O
been O
triumphing O
over O
me O
in O

                     O
a O
way O
which O
you O
have O
n't O
the O
least O
business O
to O
do O
. O

For O
, O
first O
- O
I O
suppose O
you O
read O
the O
things O
which O
happened O
to O
me O
last O
Sunday O
as O
if O
they O

                     O
meant O
that O
I O
was O
always O
to O
go O
to O
church O
- O

But O
I O
read O
them O
, O
at O
present O
- O
quite O
differently O
- O
I O
read O
them O
" O
If O

                     O
you O

                     O
intend O
to O
go O
to O
church O
, O
you O
are O
not O
to O
fail O
in O
that O
proposed O
duty O
, O

                     O
because O
you O
are O
anxious O
about O
your O
letters O
; O
but O
you O
are O
quite O
right O
in O
questioning O
whether O
it O
is O

                     O
good O
for O
you O
to O
go O
to O
church O
at O
all O
. O
" O

And O
this O
is O
at O
present O
a O
very O
principal O
question O
with O
me O
. O

Alas O
- O
I O
notice O
in O
one O
of O
your O
late O
letters O
some O
notion O
that O
I O
am O
coming O
to O
think O
the O

                     O
Bible O

" O

I O

But O
I O
never O
was O
farther O
from O
thinking O

never O
can O
be O

anything O

                 O
of O

Nothing O
I O

get O

one O
must O
above O
all O

be O
cautious O

of O
expecting O

in O
with O
much O
that O
I O

thinking O
about O

fight O

a O
great O
deal O
too O

                     O
- O
out O
of O
all O
the O
chapter O

useless O
matter O
of O
form O
- O
was O
very O

                     O
useful O
to O
me O
, O
and O
other O
things O
- O
too O
many O
to O
speak O
of O

I O
got O
dreamy O
during O
the O
Litany O
- O
looking O
at O
a O
man O
who O
was O
saying O
it O
all O
quite O
straight O

                     O
off O
, O
and O
yawning O
, O
like O
to O
split O
himself O
, O
meanwhile O

Then O
, O
they O
sang O
-(and O
you O
know O
the O
music O
's O
lovely O
) O
, O
the O
23rd O
Psalm O
- O
" O
the O
Lord O
himself O
, O

                     O
the O
mighty O
Lord O
" O
, O
& O
c O
which O
was O
nice O
for O
me O
, O
only O
I O
had O
nearly O
gone O
into O
a O
violent O
fit O
of O
-quite O
out O
- O
laughing O
by O
unluckily O

                     O
thinking O
when O
they O
came O
to O
" O
cool O
shades O
, O
and O
where O
reflecting O
waters O
flow"- O
of O
the O
top O
of O
Skiddaw B-LOC
the O
day O
before O
! O

I O
had O
to O
bite O
my O
lips O
dedful O
hard O
- O
and O
if O
anybody O
was O
looking O
they O
must O
have O
been O

                     O
shocked O
past O
all O
wonder O

Well O
- O
there O
was O
n't O
much O
more O
till O
the O
sermon O
- O
which O
was O
upon O
the O
Bible O
's O
being O
a O

                     O
Revelation O
- O
and O
it O
( O
the O
sermon O
) O
was O
so O
abominably O
bad O
that O

                     O
it O
came O
to O
me O
as O
a O
distinct O
farther O
assertion O
of O
the O
Bible O
's O
being O
no O
such O
thing O
- O
and O
the O
more O

                     O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
man O
, O
the O
more O
his O
face O
seemed O
to O
me O
like O
one O

                 O
of O
the O
ugly O
faces O
under O
the O
cathedral O
gutters O
, O
spouting O
out O
dirty O
water O
, O
- O
pure O
once O
, O
but O
defiled O
by O

                     O
them O
and O
the O
dirt O
ofinside O
the O
leaden O
gutters O
they O
stick O
on O
- O
and O
I O
felt O
how O

                     O
completely O
here O
was O
a O
priest O
of O
Baal O
, O
- O
who O
wanted O
extinction O
as O
soon O
as O
might O
be O
. O

And O
yet O
the O
man O
quite O
believed O
in O
himself O
, O
and O
in O
all O
he O
was O
saying O
- O
or O
trying O
to O
say O

And O
then O
I O
came O
away O
- O
on O
the O
whole O
much O
helped O
and O
taught O
, O
and O
satisfied O

                     O
that O
from O
that O
Rosie's B-PER
rose O
day O
, O

was O
meant O
to O
go O
to O
church O
again O

So O
I O
'll O
take O
you O
to O

about O
among O
the O
lovely O

                         O
rocks O
of O
the O
