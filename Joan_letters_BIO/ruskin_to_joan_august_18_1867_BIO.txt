It O
was O
quite O
a O
lovely O
day O
, O
this O
; O
and O
got O
brighter O
and O
sweeter O
in O
the O
afternoon O
- O
so O
after O

                     O
dinner O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
take O
another O
walk O
up O
Skiddaw B-LOC
and O
say O
goodbye O
to O

                     O
Scotland B-LOC
for O
this O
time O
- O
I O
dined O
at O
1/2 O
past O
3 O
, O
and O
got O
out O
at O
1/2 O
past O
four O
, O

                     O
quietly O
, O
and O
went O
very O
gently O
, O
at O
Sunday O
pace O
- O
stopping O
to O
look O
at O
the O
soft O
sky O
over O
the O
ferny O

                     O
slopes O
of O
the O
hill O
, O
and O
wishing O
that O
one O
fernie B-FLO
was O
there O
- O
instead O
of O
so O

                     O
many O

I O
ca O
n't O
think O
how O
the O
time O
went O
, O
but O
it O
was O
nearly O
seven O
before O
I O
got O
up O
- O
and O
the O
sun O

                     O
had O
sunk O
behind O
a O
grey O
wall O
of O
soft O
cloud O
- O
but O
under O
that O
, O
Scotland B-LOC
was O

                     O
clearer O
than O
I O
ever O
saw O
it O
, O
every O
indentation O
of O
the O
opposite O
coast O
of O
the O
Solway O
visible O
, O
as O
far O

                     O
as O
the O
entrance O
to O
Glen O
Luce O
bay B-LOC
: O
Criffel B-LOC
looking O
close O

                     O
by O
, O
and O
the O
two O
masses O
of O
the O
hills O
, O
beyond O
Wigton B-LOC
quite O
clear O

So O
I O
bid O
them O
goodbye O
, O
and O
prayed O
for O
my O
wee O
' O
amie O
, O
that O
my O
love O
for O
her O
, O
and O
my O

                     O
joy O
in O
her O
happiness O
, O
might O
always O
make O
those O
native O
hills O
of O
hers O
as O
sweet O
a O
sight O

                     O
to O
me O
as O
they O
were O
to O
day O

It O
was O
very O
beautiful O
, O
as O
the O
sun O
sank O
the O
light O
went O
more O
& O
more O
into O
golden O
bars O

                     O
far O
north O
- O
behind O
Criffel B-LOC
- O
nearly O
even O
to O
the O
ranges O
of O
the O

                     O
Moffat O
hills B-LOC

The O
isle O
of O
Man B-LOC
was O
dim O
under O
the O
grey O
cloud O
, O
the O
Cumberland O
hills B-LOC
dark O
and O
clear O
- O
I O
could O
not O
leave O
it O

For O
though O
I O
was O
depressed O
& O
ill O
much O
of O
the O
time O

                     O
I O
was O
at O
Wigton B-LOC
, O
and O
yet O
I O
have O
a O
dear O

                     O
recollection O
of O
it O
, O
and O
of O
its O
kindnesses O
to O
me O
, O
and O
of O
our O
first O
walk O
up O
to O
the O
monument O
, O
that O

                     O
happy O
afternoon O

And O
I O
looked O
- O
and O
looked O
again O
- O
and O
could O
n't O
say O
goodbye O
- O
I O
was O
still O
on O
Skiddaw O
top B-LOC

                     O
at O
1/4 O
to O

it O
getting O
rapidly O
dark O
though O
so O
clear O
- O
all O
the O
light O
was O
confined O
to O
the O

crimson O
flakes O
far O
beyond O
the O
northern O
horizon O

So O
I O
had O
to O
go O
- O

my O

                     O
compass O

I O
can O
stay O
as O
long O
on O
the O
hilltops O
as O
I O
like O
- O
and O
then O
they O
'll O
