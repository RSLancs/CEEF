It is fine to - day , at last ; & was not bad , yesterday and I had a walk right round Derwent water , a good ten miles - before dinner , and another two hours scrambling walk in the evening , and slept all night long , only dreaming of being in a cathedral and hearing music and a sweet song , of which I could not make out the words , but the name of it was " Bouche douce " " Sweet mouth " . By the way - I 've had it in my mind to tell you a hundred times , that coloured photograph you gave me is coloured over an orginal which none of us have , and its a shame . And though the colouring of the hair and cheek is nice , it has spoiled the eyes . Try if you can get an uncoloured one 10 o'clock And so - here comes in the letter with the rose , and the crumbs , besides of pure manna . And I 'll some on Wednesday , ' amie dear just as you bid . I am so very thankful for these crumbs - for I thought she had been put under some mew forbidding not even to name me , and that you were trying to keep it from me as long as you could . I have several notes to answer - forgive this short one - because if it were ever so long , it could'nt thank you enough - or her . Love to Mama , and Kate . and Mary . and Arbuthnot . 1 o'clock I 've been to church , and put a sovereign which I had been saving to by minerals with , into the offertory plate . And I 'm so happy , though it 's an East wind again . If only it would carry me with it ! westwards . Write me yet a line to - morrow with any final directions to Derwent water Hotel Keswick Cumberland
