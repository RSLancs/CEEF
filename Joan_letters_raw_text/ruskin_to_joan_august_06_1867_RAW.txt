I really think you may consider yourself poor Downes ' guardian angel!- Whenever he 's " lain forfoughten " and as unable to a foot farther as Bailie Nicol Jarvie at Aberfoil , he always " looks for a fern " However he got up Skiddaw triumphantly at last , and came down again like a ball Crawley saysis very cruel for I did n't see it , though the simile is mine ! It was half past eleven before we started and it is a half hour walk to the foot of the hill . I took care of Downes half way up and gave him two rests and then went on myself , and got up by ten minutes past two - it is nice being alone on Skiddaw top , the air was quite soft , though fresh , and it has the widest view of all the lake hills , the enormous plains about Carlisle and sweep of Solway and sea , and the sea of hills , southward being much finer than from Saddleback but the mountain itself far inferior . I am really afraid of getting interested in anything - lest I should be tempted to work of any kind - so I just walked to and fro on the top for a quarter of an hourlittle while - and then ran down again It is soft ground or shale all the way and nothing to be taken care of - except here & there a heather tuft ; so I was able to go with free speed - and I came down in less than an hour and a quarter , leaping the fence from the moor into the turnpike road at the bottom at three minutes short of the half hour past three - and I could have done it in an hour , easily , on a cool day , but it was very hot near the bottom on the south slope I did the bit of turnpike road satisfactorily - though it was hot , and got into my room and fairly for dinner before the clock struck four So I 'm quite satisfied now that Rosie wo n't have to wait for me - or turn back for me - in walks among hills ; which is a great calm to my mind I 'm going up Helvellyn tomorrow - if fine it is fine on the way to Ambleside , when I shall get your letter in the evening - I leave this behind me , for surety in case of missing Ambleside Post I had another lovely sunset on the lake after dinner - at my favourite island -- there was some hay fresh cut in the fields above the rocky lake shore , and just above the rocks , there is a fringe of beautiful trees ; - separating the fields from the lake ; the sun was setting behind the hayfields , and making them like heaps of gold , seen through the branches of the wild trees ; then glancing down across the water to my island and shining through the heather - on that - and at last just a little into my eyes as I lay half asleep , half looking at it , just to let it have the finer charm of dreamland I lost the lock of my boatchain among the heather , I did not notice it - so sleepy I was I had a great deal more to say - but I 've to see to packing up
