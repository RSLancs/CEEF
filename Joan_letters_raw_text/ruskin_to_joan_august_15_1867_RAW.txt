I fear you will be disappointed when you find this thick letter only a heap of various ones , but I think most of them will interest you . See message in George 's about sausages and wine . I have told Miss Hill she may write to mama on the birthday Keep Constance's for me . She complains much of you not writing to her . I thought it was all the other way . I am just leaving for Langdale in a grievously wet day . I wrote to Tom Richmond last night , giving up all thoughts of the Windermere house - as far as I am concerned . This climate is well enough for walking & eating - but not for living in . Did I tell you the saying of a little girl , communicated to me the other day by a clergyman 's wife - " It 's so difficult to know where God ends , and the Devil begins " It is long since I heard something so comprehensive of all problems of human life - ( and weather ! - How it does rain this morning ! ) Nothing to answer I see - Thank mama for Lily's letter
