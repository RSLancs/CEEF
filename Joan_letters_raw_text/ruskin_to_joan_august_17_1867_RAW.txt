I 'm so glad my letters have made you happy I did write them carefully , thinking of what my itie ' amie was feeling , ( and I know , pretty well . ) But they 're all true - though I chose among true things , what I thought would comfort itie ' amie the most . You would hardly think it , but I 'm very uncomfortable myself , with losing count of my days , - the new 1 . 2 . 3 seems to go on so dedful slow I was very miserable yesterday , I could n't tell why , but nothing gave me the least pleasure . Today , it poured of rain all day long I had left some stones that I wanted on Skiddaw top , so I thought I might as well go and fetch them I got a rough poney , and a little boy to ride him , between two saddlebags for the stones , and started at 12 oclock , Crawley & all - The rain got heavier every foot we mounted - and when we got to the shoulder of flat moor , under the summmit , the cloud was as thick as London fog , and I had to go by my compass - I struck the path for the summit without an error of ten feet - after a mile 's walking straight into the cloud The wind got fierce near the top , and the little boy - ( - in a far away way he was like Rosie )- got rather frightened and cold I left him in as sheltered a place as I could find - with Crawley to take care of him - & went on to the top myself - The rain was crashing among the shingle like a waterspout but the wind , strangely enough , lulled nearjust at the summmit - and I stopped a little which then - in my usual way - - I was wet through of course - all about the limbs , so i could kneel down on the stones without caring Then I dug up the stone I had hidden & came back to Crawley and the boy - and found some more of my nests and filled my saddlebags , and braced up the little fellow between them , and cheered him up , too and I 'm going to give him a suit of clothes tomorrow , and set off downwards I saw him safe enough across the moor into the regular horse path , and then left him to Crawley and came down myself by a short cut It rained worse at the top than it had done at the bottom - and when I got down again - it rained at the bottom worst of all ! I got home by 1/2 past four - dined at 5 and had nearly a pint of sherry - your boy a basin of hot soup , rich & fine now I 've had tea too , and am very jolly What beasts we are ! Yesterday doing nothing , & drinking little , in spite of all self - examination & lecturing and proper thinking - I was utterly wretched - today , I 've had a wetting and a pint of sherry , & I 'm all right Sunday morning 18th Aug It 's very odd , i always feel so much better after these wet days than after dry ones I 'm as fresh as a daisy - this morning - Not much inclined ot go to church , though - - but I shall - and see what is said to me- For you and Auntie have , I doubt not , been triumphing over me in a way which you have n't the least business to do . For , first - I suppose you read the things which happened to me last Sunday as if they meant that I was always to go to church - But I read them , at present - quite differently - I read them " If you intend to go to church , you are not to fail in that proposed duty , because you are anxious about your letters ; but you are quite right in questioning whether it is good for you to go to church at all . " And this is at present a very principal question with me . Alas - I notice in one of your late letters some notion that I am coming to think the Bible the " word of God " - because I use it - out of Rosie's book - for daily teaching , ( N . B , ) verse for today Ps . 47 . 7 . ) - But I never was farther from thinking - and never can be nearer to , thinking , anything of the sort Nothing I could ever persuade me that God writes vulgar Greek If an angel all over peacocks ' feathers were to appear in the bit of blue sky now over Castle crag - and to write on it in flat letters - " God writes vulgar Greek " - I should say -"you are the Devil , peacocks ' feathers and all If there is any divine truth at all in the mixed collection of books which we call a Bible , that truth is , that the Word of God comes directlyUNDERLINEBIO to different people in different ways ; and may do so to you or to me , today , and has nothing whatever to do with printed books , and that on the contrary , people may read that same collection of printed books all day long all their lives , and never , through all their lives hear or receive one syllable of " God 's word " That cross in the sky was the word of God to you - as far as I can at present suppose anything , in such matters - at all events it may have been - and in the clouds of 19th July - and the calm sky of last Monday morning - there may have been the Word of God to me . And continually , by and through the words of any book in which we reverently expect divine teaching , in , the word of God may come to us : and because I love Rosie so , I think God does teach me , every morning , by her lips , through her book , at all events , I know I get good by believing this But one must above all things be cautious of allowing one 's vanity to meddle in the matter - or of expecting a perpetual Divine help and interference Most peoples religion is so inwoven with their vanity that ittheir religion becomes the worst thing about them . There was a trial in the papers only the other day about a woman who had her head turned by having 500,000 pounds left her - she said she was the Holy Ghost , and whenever she went into church , said -"If only the people knew who I am ! " { My wee , busy , useful pussie , cuzzies own wee pussie - please as far as you can arrange at once the following matters for me I. I shall not be able to go with Mr Richmond to see pictures - I am resolved to see and do nothing whatever that I can help that I should like to + and I should mightily have liked that + I mean of serious things , of course I shall like to take ' amies to see heathers , and the second piece of business is II . Please accept with heartiest gratitude the kind offer to get us archbishops permission to run in heather - but that George may know what he 's about - & whom he 's letting into consecrated ground - read him the end of this letter ( no - do n't , but tell him the sense of it . ) III . I shall be delighted to see Willie whenever he can come , or likes to , ( Julia would get my letter yesterday morning . ) } Well - I 've been to church , and have made up my mind that I shall continue to go - - First , you see , the psalms for the day seemed to go straight at what I was troubling me in remembering the days ( 90 , 12th and 15th ) and the 91st had many things in it for me and the 92nd , 4th is was always an old standard verse of mine Well - then , came the Obadiah & Elijah chapters , which fell in with much that I had been thinking about the fight I should have with the clergymen - showing how priests of Baal really believe their own mission , and how to bequoted and killed out of it - ca n't be put to shame in their own hearts - I got a great deal too - out of all the chapter - the rainy bits - especially Then in the second lesson , the bit about Timotheus' father being Greek , & Paul's giving way to the useless matter of form - was very useful to me , and other things - too many to speak of I got dreamy during the Litany - looking at a man who was saying it all quite straight off , and yawning , like to split himself , meanwhile Then , they sang -(and you know the music 's lovely ) , the 23rd Psalm - " the Lord himself , the mighty Lord " , & c which was nice for me , only I had nearly gone into a violent fit of -quite out - laughing by unluckily thinking when they came to " cool shades , and where reflecting waters flow"- of the top of Skiddaw the day before ! I had to bite my lips dedful hard - and if anybody was looking they must have been shocked past all wonder Well - there was n't much more till the sermon - which was upon the Bible 's being a Revelation - and it ( the sermon ) was so abominably bad that it came to me as a distinct farther assertion of the Bible 's being no such thing - and the more I looked at the man , the more his face seemed to me like one of the ugly faces under the cathedral gutters , spouting out dirty water , - pure once , but defiled by them and the dirt ofinside the leaden gutters they stick on - and I felt how completely here was a priest of Baal , - who wanted extinction as soon as might be . And yet the man quite believed in himself , and in all he was saying - or trying to say And then I came away - on the whole much helped and taught , and satisfied that from that Rosie's rose day , I was meant to go to church again . So I 'll take you to Mr Bridges on this day week , God willing , and him It 's a lovely day and I 'm going to have some dinner now , and then row about among the lovely rocks of the lake shore , till sunset Miss Bell is sending me some money from Winnington - I told her to register the half notes to you - as I do n't know if they would come safe in time to Langdale - where I 'm going back on Tuesday When you get them , write to say you have - & the other halves will come
