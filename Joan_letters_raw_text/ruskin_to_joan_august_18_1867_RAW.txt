It was quite a lovely day , this ; and got brighter and sweeter in the afternoon - so after dinner , I thought I could take another walk up Skiddaw and say goodbye to Scotland for this time - I dined at 1/2 past 3 , and got out at 1/2 past four , quietly , and went very gently , at Sunday pace - stopping to look at the soft sky over the ferny slopes of the hill , and wishing that one fernie was there - instead of so many I ca n't think how the time went , but it was nearly seven before I got up - and the sun had sunk behind a grey wall of soft cloud - but under that , Scotland was clearer than I ever saw it , every indentation of the opposite coast of the Solway visible , as far as the entrance to Glen Luce bay : Criffel looking close by , and the two masses of the hills , beyond Wigton quite clear So I bid them goodbye , and prayed for my wee ' amie , that my love for her , and my joy in her happiness , might always make those native hills of hers as sweet a sight to me as they were to day It was very beautiful , as the sun sank the light went more & more into golden bars far north - behind Criffel - nearly even to the ranges of the Moffat hills The isle of Man was dim under the grey cloud , the Cumberland hills dark and clear - I could not leave it For though I was depressed & ill much of the time I was at Wigton , and yet I have a dear recollection of it , and of its kindnesses to me , and of our first walk up to the monument , that happy afternoon And I looked - and looked again - and could n't say goodbye - I was still on Skiddaw top at 1/4 to eight , it getting rapidly dark though so clear - all the light was confined to the crimson flakes far beyond the northern horizon . So I had to go - but I 'm going to buy myself a horn lantern , and with that and my compass , I can stay as long on the hilltops as I like - and then they 'll take me for a will - o - the wisp , as I go down - which will be delicious . ( pernicious - I mean - " is too weak ) I came down at a good pace , but it got all but dark before I was quite off the hills , and I had to go cautiously - however - I was in my room at home at 1/2 past nine , sitting down to tea . -and I hope for a nice stretchy , lazy nights sleep I 'm very thankful to find I can take Skiddaw for an after dinner ramble , I am really getting on gradually . Monday morning Nasty tiersome Monday - no letters from ' amie ( Oh , ' amie dear , what do you think I did yesterday ? Something so dedful - - we dined on - we dedful assured- - we dined on - its of ' amie ! ) I 'm packing up today & ca n't write more - See envelope again tomorrow
