There 's a nasty cross post from Scotland here , and I 've no letters since Sunday . I suppose it 's all right - but if I can , I 'll send a telegram to know if I may come to - morrow . If I ca n't , I 'll come anyhow - There 's a Rosie bit of talk ! if ever there was ! I was making some more wee piggie verses lastnight , wholly for my own instruction and improvement - but here they are for my wee wee piggie on the next leaf . when ' itie pigs have muffin 's hot And take Three quarters for thier lot , Then ' itie pigs - had better not . when ' itie pigs at tea have got of Orange Marmalade a pot , They would have next - I wonder what ? That metre , I perceive is vex't . The cart before the horse annex'd . But , should my piggie by puplex'd , The verse , re - versed , makes better text " I wonder what they would have next " ! I also see I should have said A pot - of Orange Marmalade . And people who punctilious are Politely call a " pot " a " jar " . But if pigs say what pigs intended the least they say is soonest mended . And that was what - ( you dear I. P. ) your cuzzie - piggie had , for tea .
