I hope you will be very happy - to - day - to - morrow and ever after - and that you will always be happier because of your good brother to - day made yours and not less happy in your tiresome querulous cuzzie - you know - it must be nice having somebody to scold sometimes - and one must'nt one 's husband ! - Mind that ( and tellKate ) and love me always and believe me ever your loving Cousin . You were to have had a long letter but I 've been out in the rain , & hindered . but I 'm getting stronger I 've been climbing to - day as high as your highest hill ( 1400 ) , in the rain & wind .
