I 'm very glad Kate is'nt here ! there are very bad lessons going on in the passage - an innocent husband just called to his wife from his dressingroom " Where 's my lake - Guidebook ? " And the wife replied " you ought to know ! " I 've sent you such a packet of nicest letters to - day - I had torn Mrs. H 's acrofs then thought you might like to see it . It 's very stingy and naughty of mama to write her poor boy no Sunday letter - He wo n't be a good boy if he does'nt get Sundays letters . He 'll go and eat too much muffin again . So you 're actually going to home to - morrow ! you dear nice pussy . But poor grannie ! what is she to do - I shall drink to Kate's health , and good behaviour to - day . I wonder where she 's going to ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - It 's raining here - in it 's prettiest way - I believe it thinks it that it 's the right thing to do always . I shall write to Denmark Hill to - morrow .
