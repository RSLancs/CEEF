					<notes>Line 29- should we be tagging ‘Fernie’ as a flora… I think he’s referring to her here?
Line 32- changed ‘after’ to ‘under’. 
Line 58- couldn’t work out the gap. 
Line 64- changed ‘sketchy’ to ‘stretchy’. 
Line 71- the gap is ‘tiresome Monday’ but I think JR has spelt tiresome ‘tiersome’
Line 74- the gap is ‘we dedful assured’ (I think...). 
Line 82- I switched ‘Ever’ for ‘For’, ‘Fernie’ for ‘Joanie’, and added the new expan mark up for ‘fectionate.</notes>

	                <s id="s1">It was quite a lovely day, this; and got brighter and sweeter in the afternoon - so after
	                    dinner, I thought I could take another walk up <rs key="Q2292191" type="place">Skiddaw</rs> and say goodbye to
	                    <rs key="Q22" type="place">Scotland</rs> for this time - I dined at 1/2 past 3, and got out at 1/2 past four,
	                    quietly, and went very gently, at Sunday pace - stopping to look at the soft sky over the ferny
	                    slopes of the hill, and wishing that one <rs key="Q80005" type="flora">fernie</rs> was there - instead of so
	                    many</s>
	                <s id="s2">I can't think how the time went, but it was nearly seven before I got up - and the sun
	                    had sunk behind a grey wall of soft cloud - but under that, <rs key="Q22" type="place">Scotland</rs> was
	                    clearer than I ever saw it, every indentation of the opposite coast of the Solway visible, as far
	                    as the entrance to <rs key="Q6696423" type="place">Glen Luce bay</rs>: <rs key="Q5185126" type="place">Criffel</rs> looking close

	                <s id="s3">So I bid them goodbye, and prayed for my wee 'amie, that my love for her, and my
