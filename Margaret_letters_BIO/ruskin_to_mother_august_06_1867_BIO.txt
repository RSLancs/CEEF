I O
wished O
old O
times O
could O
come O
back O
again O
, O
on O
Skiddaw B-LOC
top O
to O
day O

Nothing O
in O
the O
world O
is O
so O
entirly O
entirely O
unchanged O
in O

                     O
aspect O
as O
these O
hilltops O
and O
the O
five O
- O
and O
- O
thirty O
years O
are O
there O
" O
as O
a O
mist O
that O
rolls O
away O

But O
I O
am O
really O
thankful O
to O
find O
myself O
so O
strong O
of O

                     O
limb O
again O
in O
the O
course O
of O
only O
a O
months O
practice O

I O
went O
up O
in O
two O
hours O
, O
and O
was O
coming O
down O
in O
dreadful O
speed O
, O
in O
the O
condition O
which O
- O

                     O
if O
I O
were O
a O
horse O
, O
would O
be O
described O
as O
" O
without O
a O
hair O
turned O
" O
when O
I O
met O
a O
strong O
looking O
man O

                 O
in O
cha O
a O
guide O
's O
charge O
- O
panting O
for O
breath O
- O
he O
asked O
me O
" O
if O
I O
had O

                 O
such O
a O
thing O
as O
a O
drop O
of O
brandy O
, O
for O
he O
had O
forgotten O
to O
bring O
any O
up O

I O
told O
him O
, O
" O
it O
was O
not O
the O
least O
cold O
at O
teh O
top O
& O
he O
could O
rest O
there O
as O
long O
as O
he O

                 O
liked O
- O
and O
he O
would O
be O
much O
better O
with O
no O
brandy O
" O

-He O
was O
superfluous O
enough O
to O
thank O
me O
in O
this O
not O
very O
extensive O
consolation O
, O
but O
Crawley B-PER
says O
it O
turned O
cold O
at O
the O
top O
very O
soon O
after O
I O
left O
it O
, O
so O
I O

                     O
hope O
the O
poor O
man O
got O
his O
brandy O
from O
someone O
else O

I O
must O
close O
my O
letter O
tonight O
- O
for O
I O
go O
to O
Ambleside B-LOC
tomorrow O
, O

                     O
but O
there O
's O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
in O
Joannas B-PER

I O
had O
a O
nice O
letter O
from O
Norton B-LOC
today O
