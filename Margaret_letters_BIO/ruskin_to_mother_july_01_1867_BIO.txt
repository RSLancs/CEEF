Low O
- O
wood B-LOC
was O
too O
noisy O
and O
fashionable O
- O
( O
Manchester B-LOC
fashion I-LOC
) O
for O
me O
. O

So O
I O
drove O
over O
here O
yesterday O
and O
got O
a O
lovely O
little O
corner O
- O
parlour O
in O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
your O
old O
Inn O
- O
though O
I O
am O
confused O
about O
it O
, O
the O
view O
seeming O
to O
me O
so O
		 O
much O
more O
beautiful O
than O
it O
did O
then O
. O

But O
the O
change O
in O
myself O
and O
in O
all O
things O
connected O
with O
me O
: O
is O
so O
great O
, O
and O
so O
sorrowful O
to O
me O
, O
that O
I O
can O
hardly O
bear O
the O
places O
. O

It O
is O
very O
different O
, O
having O
you O
laid O
up O
at O
home O
, O
and O
my O
father O
dead O
- O
myself O
old O
and O
ill O
, O
from O
running O
about O
the O
hills O
, O
with O
both O
of O
you O
expecting O
me O
home O
		 O
to O
tea O
, O
and O
   O
I O
myself O
as O
lithe O
as O
a O
stag O
. O

I O
would O
give O
anything O
to O
be O
back O
at O
home O
at O
work O
with O
my O
minerals O
: O

But O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
the O
fresh O
air O
and O
exercise O
are O
, O
not O
only O
good O
for O
me O
, O
but O
vitally O
necessary O
just O
now O
- O
so O
I O
must O
endure O
my O
rest O
and O
libery O
with O
		 O
patience O
. O

I O
had O
a O
pleasant O
row O
across O
the O
lake O
last O
night O
, O
and O
it O
is O
all O
very O
lovely O
. O

I O
went O
up O
and O
examined O
Mr. O
Richmonds B-PER
estate O
before O
dinner O
, O
the O
father O
and O
son O
( O
of O
the O
farm O
) O
, O
showing O
me O
everything O
with O
great O
		 O
courtesy O
and O
niceness O

It O
is O
very O
beautiful O
- O
but O
the O
railroad O
station O
, O
not O
a O
mile O
distant O
is O
a O
fatal O
eyesore O
- O
if O
Mr. O
Richmosnd O
builds O
the O
		 O
house O
at O
all O
for O
me O
my O
princpile O
study O
- O
room O
must O
be O
at O
the O
back O
, O
looking O
up O
to O
the O
rocks O
and O
wild O
- O
roses B-FLO
, O
( O
very O
lovely O
		 O
both O
, O
just O
now O
) O
and O
only O
the O
company O
- O
room O
looking O
to O
the O
great O
view O
- O
a O
very O
noble O
one O
, O
but O
for O
the O
railroad O
and O
having O
the O
advantage O
of O
		 O
endless O
stufy O
of O
magnificent O
sunset O
. O

I O
am O
much O
struck O
by O
the O
fiery O
purity O
and O
power O
of O
the O
northern O
skys O
- O
last O
night O
was O
more O
like O
an O
Aurora O
		 O
BorealisMETEROLOGYBIO O
than O
mere O
sunset O
the O
fire O
seemed O
in O
the O
clouds O
and O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
night O
. O

It O
is O
twilight O
till O
eleven O
and O
clear O
dawn O
at O
two O
- O
( O
as O
I O
know O
- O
to O
my O
discomfort O
) O
when O
sleepless O

I O
hope O
to O
reach O
Huntly O
burn B-LOC
about O
5 O
o'clock O
to O
- O
day O
. O

I O
leave O
this O
note O
behind O
me O
here O
to O
be O
sure O
of O
post O
. O

I O
will O
send O
you O
an O
envelope O
from O
Huntly O
burn B-LOC
- O
I O
ca O
n't O
to O
- O
day O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
shall O
choose O
to O
stay O
longer O
that O
a O
day O
there O
( O
they O
ask O
me O
) O
it O
depends O
so O
much O
on O
thier O
ways O
. O
