I O
have O
your O
nice O
line O
of O
yesterday O
, O
and O
am O
very O
glad O
of O
your O
account O
of O
Janie B-PER
and O
her O
quiet O
ways O

The O
letter O
from O
Mr. O
Brown B-PER
of O
Venice B-LOC
contained I-LOC
nothing O
particular O
, O
but O
he O
is O
quite O
well O
. O

I O
had O
a O
really O
fine O
walk O
yesterday O
, O
discovering O
two O
pieces O
of O
mountain O
scenery O
, O
hitherto O
unknown O
to O
me O
, O
and O
very O
truly O
noble O
- O
buttresses O
of O
fork O
on O
the O
flanks O
of O
Grasmoor B-LOC
, O
between O
this O
lake O
and O
Crummock O
water B-LOC
, O
which O
may O
compare O
not O
disadvantageously O
with O
many O
pieces O
of O
Swiss B-LOC
scenery O
. O

I O
was O
delighted O
to O
find O
them O
, O
as O
it O
is O
always O
good O
to O
have O
a O
motive O
for O
one O
's O
walks O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
want O
to O
see O
these O
on O
all O
sides O
. O

The O
weather O
was O
delightful O
- O
though O
sudden O
and O
mysterious O
blasts O
of O
wind O
came O
up O
through O
the O
gorges O
, O
the O
tops O
of O
the O
hills O
were O
all O
in O
perfect O
repose O
. O

I O
had O
rather O
a O
severe O
walk O
of O
five O
hours O
, O
without O
stopping O
more O
than O
twenty O
minutes O
in O
all O
- O
( O
I O
never O
drew O
bridle O
once O
, O
from O
here O
to O
Grassmoor B-LOC
top O
, O
five O
miles O
, O
and O
2800 O
ft O
. O
up O
. O
) O
- O
and O
came O
in O
very O
fresh O
, O
and O
frightfully O
hungry O
, O
so O
I O
must O
certainly O
be O
gaining O
strength O
. O

Your O
letter O
to O
- O
day O
is O
very O
prettily O
written O
so O
you O
are O
certainly O
not O
losing O
it O
. O

I O
take O
some O
pains O
with O
my O
writing O
, O
but O
am O
always O
shocked O
to O
look O
at O
it O
afterwards O
. O

I O
had O
a O
botanist O
breakfasting O
with O
me O
to O
- O
day O
who O
wrote O
a O
most O
beautiful O
hand O
- O
but O
he O
was O
one O
lump O
of O
pleasant O
active O
egotism O
- O
utterly O
insensitive O
, O
and O
I O
fancy O
my O
broken O
hand O
comes O
partly O
of O
sensitiveness O
, O
which O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
loose O
. O

I O
enclose O
August O
cheque O
- O
with O
love O
- O
You O
must O
put O
your O
name O
on O
the O
back O
. O
