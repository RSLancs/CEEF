I O
expect O
your O
letter O
every O
minute O
, O
but O
have O
litte O
to O
tell O
you O
in O
answer O
, O
except O
that O
the O
walks O
here O
are O
very O
beautiful O
, O
and O
that O
though O
I O
went O
early O
to O
bed O
, O
		 O
I O
was O
so O
sound O
asleep O
at O
seven O
o'clock O
that O
Crawley B-PER
had O
to O
knock O
five O
times O
- O
each O
louder O
that O
before O
, O
which O
as O
Ann B-PER
will O
		 O
tell O
you O
is O
a O
different O
state O
of O
things O
from O
my O
sleeping O
at O
home O
. O

But O
I O
an O
doing O
no O
work O
and O
am O
in O
the O
air O
all O
day O
. O

I O
have O
just O
got O
your O
two O
sweet O
letters O
, O
which O
though O
you O
say O
must O
accustom O
yourself O
more O
to O
writing O
, O
are O
the O
most O
legible O
I O
have O
to O
- O
day O
received O
		 O
- O
Entirely O
legible O
thoughout O
. O

About O
the O
house O
cleaning O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
need O
not O
hurry O
it O
, O
for O
I O
think O
, O
if O
I O
begin O
really O
to O
gain O
strength O
here O
, O
I O
ought O
to O
stay O
some O
time O
and O
so O
all O
I O
		 O
can O
to O
lay O
in O
store O
of O
health O
for O
the O
winter O
. O

I O
have O
hardly O
yet O
begun O
to O
get O
ant O
excercise O
- O
yesterday O
was O
the O
first O
day O
I O
could O
really O
walk O
with O
any O
pleasure O
and O
I O
an O
sadly O
stiff O
and O
weak O
- O
		 O
and O
clearly O
in O
absolute O
need O
of O
some O
persistance O
in O
the O
process O
, O
though O
I O
think O
of O
you O
at O
home O
very O
sorrowfully O
- O
but O
I O
can O
not O
venture O
to O
		 O
lead O
sedentary O
life O
again O
yet O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
send O
you O
a O
larger O
letter O
on O
Monday O
. O

Perhaps O
Miss O
Fall B-PER
would O
kindly O
read O
you O
the O
enclosed O
about O
Miss O
Ironside B-PER
. O

It O
may O
be O
of O
interest O
to O
you O
. O

Your O
envelope O
was O
beautifully O
directed O
, O
better O
than O
mine O
, O
but O
here O
is O
one O
for O
you O
. O

I O
forgot O
to O
say O
I O
told O
Connie B-PER
thay O
sometimes O
if O
on O
a O
fine O
afternoon O
, O
she O
liked O
without O
coming O
into O
the O
house O
to O
bring O
her O
companions O
for O
thier O
afternoon O
walk O
round O
the O
garden O
, O
and O
have O
a O
talk O
with O
Downes B-PER
, O
it O
would O
not O
disturb O
you O
, O
and O
would O
be O
a O
great O
privilege O
to O
them O
. O
