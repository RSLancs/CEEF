The O
weather O
, O
though O
varying O
from O
windy O
and O
cold O
, O
to O
thundery O
and O
hot O
, O
allows O
me O
to O
get O
out O
nearly O
all O
day O
long O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
I O
gain O
more O
than O
I O
		 O
feel O
, O
- O
one O
can O
not O
set O
a O
complete O
reaction O
of O
the O
system O
on O
foot O
in O
a O
week O
. O

I O
met O
one O
of O
Acland's B-PER
friends O
a O
Mr. O
Butler B-PER
, O
the O
brother O
of O
the O
head O
master O
of O
Harrow B-LOC
, O
on O
		 O
the O
lake O
yesterday O
: O
he O
was O
being O
rowed O
by O
the O
" O
Lord O
of O
the O
Isles O
, O
" O
the O
gentlemen O
who O
lives O
in O
the O
house O
on O
the O
island O
: O
and O
they O
wanted O
me O
to O
go O
and O
see O
them O
in O
their O
		 O
Atlantic O
: O
I O
would O
not O
: O
but O
promised O
when O
I O
came O
back O
, O
which O
I O
really O
mean O
to O
do O
, O
to O
report O
myself O
at O
the O
island O
- O
it O
will O
on O
the O
whole O
be O
more O
good O
than O
		 O
harm O
that O
I O
should O
know O
some O
of O
the O
people O
living O
here O
: O
and O
besides O
, O
I O
can O
not O
help O
it O
but O
by O
mere O
savagery O
. O

I O
have O
just O
got O
your O
long O
and O
quite O
legible O
letter O
of O
yesterday O
enclosing O
Mr. O
Richmond's B-PER
, O
very O
nice O
. O

I O
will O
take O
care O
about O
lake O
air O
& O
c O
in O
evening O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
instinct O
in O
everybody O
in O
health O
, O
to O
get O
upon O
the O
water O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
which O
has O
		 O
been O
the O
same O
in O
all O
ages O
. O

There O
is O
more O
marsh O
about O
these O
lakes O
than O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
however O
, O
and O
I O
will O
take O
care O
. O
