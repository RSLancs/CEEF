I O
was O
detained O
by O
weather O
yesterday O
, O
but O
am O
really O
off O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
hope O
to O
send O
you O
telegram O
from O
Keswick B-LOC
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
as O
soon O
, O
		 O
almost O
, O
as O
you O
can O
get O
this O
. O

I O
have O
given O
great O
pleasure O
by O
coming O
here O
, O
and O
I O
know O
several O
conditions O
of O
things O
respecting O
the O
family O
which O
enabled O
me O
to O
judge O
more O
clearly O
in O
what O
		 O
regards O
Percy B-PER
. O

That O
was O
what O
I O
mainly O
came O
for O

I O
think O
more O
highly O
of O
Joanna B-PER
and O
her O
sister O
than O
I O
did O
, O
nor O
am O
I O
disappointed O
in O
thier O
way O
of O
life O
- O
as O
compared O
with O
		 O
all O
around O
them O
: O
but O
there O
is O
much O
to O
depress O
me O
in O
the O
aspect O
of O
Scotland B-LOC
and O
in O
the O
desertion O
of O
these O
provincial O
towns O
- O
and O
I O
have O
the O
secret O
		 O
of O
extracting O
sadness O
from O
all O
things O
- O
instead O
of O
joys O
which O
is O
no O
enviable O
talisman O
. O

Forgive O
me O
if O
I O
ever O
write O
in O
a O
way O
that O
may O
pain O
you O
- O

It O
is O
best O
that O
you O
should O
know O
when O
I O
write O
cheerfully O
it O
is O
no O
pretended O
cheerfulness O
- O
so O
when O
I O
am O
sad O
- O
I O
think O
it O
right O
to O
confess O
it O
. O
