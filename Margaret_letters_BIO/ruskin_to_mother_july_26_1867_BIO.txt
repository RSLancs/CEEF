I O
have O
your O
nice O
line O
; O
but O
am O
very O
sorry O
you O
are O
so O
nervous O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
thing O
which O
can O
be O
, O
and O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
avoided O
. O

Merely O
resolving O
to O
let O
the O
house O
take O
care O
of O
itself O
for O
a O
fortnight O
and O
absolutely O
not O
allowing O
any O
one O
to O
ask O
you O
a O
question- O
( O
and O
sending O
Ann B-PER
, O
who O
would O
be O
unmanageable O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
to O
the O
seaside- O
) O
- O
letting O
Joanna B-PER
order O
dinner O
, O
and O
living- O
for O
the O
fortnight- O
upstairs- O
and O
seeing O
no O
one O
. O

You O
would O
thus O
recover O
calm O
, O
and O
confidence O
in O
yourself O
. O

I O
am O
in O
hopes O
however O
that O
having O
Joanna B-PER
at O
home O
will O
make O
a O
greatdifference O
- O
only O
she O
ought O
to O
be O
wanted O
soon O
in O
Ireland B-LOC
, O
and O
you O
know O
, O
we O
must O
get O
into O
the O
way O
of O
sparing O
her O
. O

You O
must O
forgive O
the O
nonsense O
I O
write O
to O
her O
. O

You O
will O
get O
some O
good O
of O
the O
letters O
. O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
write O
at O
all O
, O
if O
they O
were O
to O
be O
" O
serious O
" O
