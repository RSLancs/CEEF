Downes B-PER
arrived O
yesterday O
quite O
comfortably O
and O
in O
fine O
weather O
It O
is O
not O
bad O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
to O
take O
him O
for O
a O
walk O
up O
Saddleback B-LOC
, O
which O
after O
all O
is O
the O
finest O
to O
my O
mind O
, O
of O
all O
the O
Cumberland O
hills B-LOC
- O
though O
that O
is O
not O
saying O
much O
, O
for O
they O
are O
much O
lower O
in O
effect O
, O
in O
proportion O
to O
their O
real O
height O
, O
than O
I O
had O
expected- O
The O
beauty O
of O
the O
country O
is O
in O
its O
quiet O
roadside O
bits O
, O
and O
rusticity O
of O
cottage O
life O
and O
shepherd O
labour O
. O
- O
its O
mountains O
are O
sorrowfully O
melted O
away O
from O
my O
old O
dreams O
of O
them O
. O

I O
have O
your O
nice O
line O
of O
yesterday- O
I O
am O
so O
thankful O
to O
know O
that O
you O
can O
still O
read O
nicely O
.. O
it O
is O
only O
now O
& O
then O
, O
when O
you O
are O
tired O
, O
that O
I O
see O
any O
failure O
in O
the O
writing O
. O

I O
think O
that O
arrangement O
about O
not O
reading O
Joanna B-PER
's O
letters O
to O
me O
and O
only O
mine O
to O
her O
will O
be O
quite O
right O
. O

It O
will O
leave O
her O
quite O
at O
ease O
and O
unrestrained O
. O
