I O
have O
just O
written O
the O
enclosed O
letter O
to O
your O
old O
friend O
MIsabella O
Mare B-PER
. O

I O
fear O
it O
is O
badly O
written O
but O
you O
may O
like O
to O
look O
at O
it O
. O

Then O
you O
have O
only O
to O
fasten O
it O
and O
order O
to O
be O
posted O
. O

By O
a O
stupid O
mistake O
of O
David's B-PER
and O
a O
stupidness O
of O
my O
own O
I O
got O
taken O
to O
the O
wrong O
station O
on O
Friday O
lost O
the O
train O
and O
did O
not O
get O
		 O
to O
Greta O
bridge B-LOC
till O
eight O
o'clock O
instead O
of O
four O
, O
thereby O
losing O
post O
, O
so O
that O
you O
have O
been O
kept O
thus O
long O
without O
letters O
. O

I O
got O
down O
comfortably O
however O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
my O
evening O
walk O
at O
Greta O
bridge B-LOC
, O
I O
saw O
YorK B-LOC
		 O
cathedral O
, O
( O
having O
to O
wait O
there O
, O
) O
and O
some O
picturesque O
and O
very O
clean O
old O
streets O
. O

Greta O
bridge B-LOC
is O
only O
changed O
by O
being O
duller O
: O
no O
one O
ever O
goes O
there O
now O
- O
the O
Landlord O
Mr O
		 O
Moritt B-PER
, O
must O
be O
an O
utterly O
bad O
one O
- O
neglect O
and O
filth O
manifest O
themselves O
everywhere O
through O
the O
divine O
beauty O
of O
the O
country O
. O

But O
the O
Tees B-LOC
is O
turned O
into O
a O
mere O
manufacturer O
's O
drain O
- O
pipe O
. O

Nor O
is O
the O
Greta B-LOC
any O
more O
clear O
but O
I O
saw O
some O
lovely O
streams O
between O
Brough B-LOC
and O
here O
. O

This O
place O
is O
in O
view O
quite O
unchanged O
, O
but O
the O
Inn O
is O
rebuilt O
- O
and O
as O
full O
of O
not O
fasionable O
- O
but O
rich O
		 O
people O
flaunting O
about O
, O
as O
the O
hotel O
Monnet O
at O
Vevay B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
all O
painful O
and O
asddening O
to O
me O
. O

But O
I O
am O
absolutly O
in O
want O
of O
fresh O
air O
and O
idleness O
, O
and O
must O
take O
them O
as O
a O
nasty O
medicine O
, O
though O
I O
would O
incomparably O
rather O
		 O
be O
working O
amongst O
the O
camphor O
and O
ambergris O
of O
insects O
and O
mummies O
in O
the O
British O
Museum B-LOC
and O
deciphering O
wing O
- O
scales O
and O
hieroglyphs O
- O
if O
I O
		 O
could O
- O
or O
working O
all O
day O
long O
in O
my O
own O
mineral O
room O
. O

But O
I O
can O
not O
- O
and O
must O
walk O
and O
strive O
to O
bannish O
sad O
thoughts O
as O
best O
I O
can O
. O

I O
feel O
a O
little O
bettering O
in O
strength O
, O
already O
. O

The O
envelope O
enclosed O
will O
I O
doubt O
not O
safely O
reach O
me O
. O
I O
am O
very O
sorry O
for O
your O
loneliness O
this O
Sunday O
. O
