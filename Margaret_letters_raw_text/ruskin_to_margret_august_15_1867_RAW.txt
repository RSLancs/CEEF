I have writen so long a letter to Joanna , all of which is for you also , that I must not write much more to day - only your writing is quite beautiful still - more legible than Joannas ; ( which is legiblest to me of lady hands ) and I 'll be home D.V. on the 24th . but it is curious that you speak of the peace of these hills , for that is indeed the helpfullest thing of all to me - more than air or exercise - when I come back- you & Joan must go on managing the house between you , for , positively , I wo n't be bothered with it - you may open my letters you like , now . Was'nt Kingsley 's nice , about my father ?
