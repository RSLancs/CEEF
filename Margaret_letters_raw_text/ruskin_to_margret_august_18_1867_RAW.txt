Your writing is better and better every day : I would not send you so many envelopes , much as I like to have the letters , but that I see this , and that the little effort of writing them is really good for you . I looked directly at the third chapter of Job . I have not for a long while ; and it is strange to see what false despair a good man may be brought to . I have just heard of the destruction of the church of St John & Paul & at Venice , and of Titian's best picture but one , the Peter Martyr , therein , with perfect equanimity . Nevertheless there is under that , the undercurrent of the quiet and continual despair about such things which has long possessed me . If my own Turner's St Gothard were destroyed - you would find me take it just the same way . There is a good deal , I hope , in Joanna's letter , which will amuse you , and I must write no more to - day The idea of a Pipe like Robin Hood's is capital . I will begin to learn to whistle on one directly . It is , quite seriously , a right & useful idea . Full address on Envelope - being the last , I hope , here , this year .
