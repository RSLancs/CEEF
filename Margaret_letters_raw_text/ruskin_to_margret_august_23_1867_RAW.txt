I do not know when I have had a more pleasing or pathetic walk than this morning before breakfast . It was sweet , quiet sunshine , with dew on the grass , and the rocks beginning to emerge from the mist in the valley - I am at the old Inn , which Mary drew , in the old times . It is alteredadded to a little - but what was of it remains and looks much as it did . The grass flat in front , and the tree are , just the same , the garden where I used to play , & gather bits of lead ore , is still there - and the walks still sprinkled with spar , and to my great delight the old fishpond - with superb waterlilies and gold fish , and above , the green fresh - dewey fields still untouched and pure . And I 've had your nice letter , and a nice walk since breakfast - and I 've seen a cavern , and examined some strange rocks , and got a mineral or two , and had a chat with the old woman in W Smedleys shop - who has been there fifty three years , and tomorrow by about this time , I hope to be very near home , and shall be very glad to be so , and I am ever ,
