It was fine yesterday , and I took a light carriage , and drove with Downes up Borrowdale , and round under Honister - crag , to Buttermere , and played a little while at the edge of the same stream which I got scolded for dabbling in till I was too late for dinner , when I was a boy The dinner was a very bad one , I remember ; and I used it afterwards in my speech at Oxford , on Education of the Lower Classes , - because the girl at Buttermere had a piano in the parlour , and nothing in the kitchen We came home through the vale of Newlands Both passes were higher & grander than I expected ; but driving a long way through moors is duller than walking , for at least in walking , one has to look where one is going , and that is amusing . I 've just got your most nice letter of yesterday . I understand it all perfectly . I 'm very glad you like the " Selections " and about Mr Simon's garden
