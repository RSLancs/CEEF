that kept my brain at work all day . I fancied this ought to make the walk pleasanter - but I find it destroyed it , as a rest , and so I was continually getting worse in reality , whatever temporary strength might come of the exercise . but now , I wo n't so much as look at Downes's ferns , which he 's forever hunting up - and though I carry my hammer , and sometimes break a stone or two - I just pick up anything that looks interesting and give it to Crawley to pack , without ever thinking about it any more . And the idler I am , the more I find I can enjoy ; and one is n't always miserable because one has n't done enough , or ca n't find out what one wants . If it is fine tomorrow , I leave very early , and from Joanna will have no letter , but if it is not a good day - I 'll be good instead and write her one , too .
