I wished old times could come back again , on Skiddaw top to day Nothing in the world is so entirly entirely unchanged in aspect as these hilltops and the five - and - thirty years are there " as a mist that rolls away But I am really thankful to find myself so strong of limb again in the course of only a months practice I went up in two hours , and was coming down in dreadful speed , in the condition which - if I were a horse , would be described as " without a hair turned " when I met a strong looking man in cha a guide 's charge - panting for breath - he asked me " if I had such a thing as a drop of brandy , for he had forgotten to bring any up I told him , " it was not the least cold at teh top & he could rest there as long as he liked - and he would be much better with no brandy " -He was superfluous enough to thank me in this not very extensive consolation , but Crawley says it turned cold at the top very soon after I left it , so I hope the poor man got his brandy from someone else I must close my letter tonight - for I go to Ambleside tomorrow , but there 's a good deal more in Joannas I had a nice letter from Norton today
