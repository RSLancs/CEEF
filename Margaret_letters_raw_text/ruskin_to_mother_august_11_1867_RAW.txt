Your real letter will come as usual tomorrow morning . But turn leaf of this . I read your little enquiry and sentence about Downes , to Downes himself - much to his contentment All the fine weather - hills - and ferns , will not keep him any longer from his duties and you . He has added much to my enjoyment of my excursions and I am sure , will be glad to tell you about them ; he has takenmade the best out of his advantages . I feel to just as if I was introducing a new Gardener to you , and giving him a character- I should be puzzled to " give him " a better than his own . Monday morning . Exquisite weather . 1/2 past 7 . here 10 minutes to eight by you , as I know by my Father 's watch which I always wear , now ; - what a watch it is ! for rightness I gave it a kiss , with my golden letter this morning . Look here - while Joanna stays at home with us , might it not be better that I should come home for a little while , take you to Norwood , while I can still enjoy the country drives therefrom , and get the house cleaned ! - I will write more of this tomorrow , it would I think be best to .
