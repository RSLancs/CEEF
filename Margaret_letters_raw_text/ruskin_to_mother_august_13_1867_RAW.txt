I 've been writing a long letter to Joanna - thinking every now and then between sentences and it has taken so mu much more time than I intended . - and I can only say , to day in this , that I 'm very thankful to hear of that peace which came over you , and that I remain myself remain very peaceful and happy , and will write more tomorrow ( though I shall not get your letter at Keswick in time to answer it ) - I go back to Keswick because I left it before I had done , to show Downes Windermere - if it is fine tomorrow I shall go up Helvellyn again on the way back . It was too cold when I was with Downes to see all I wanted at the top .
