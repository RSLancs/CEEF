I have your nice line of yesterday , and am very glad of your account of Janie and her quiet ways The letter from Mr. Brown of Venice contained nothing particular , but he is quite well . I had a really fine walk yesterday , discovering two pieces of mountain scenery , hitherto unknown to me , and very truly noble - buttresses of fork on the flanks of Grasmoor , between this lake and Crummock water , which may compare not disadvantageously with many pieces of Swiss scenery . I was delighted to find them , as it is always good to have a motive for one 's walks , and I shall want to see these on all sides . The weather was delightful - though sudden and mysterious blasts of wind came up through the gorges , the tops of the hills were all in perfect repose . I had rather a severe walk of five hours , without stopping more than twenty minutes in all - ( I never drew bridle once , from here to Grassmoor top , five miles , and 2800 ft . up . ) - and came in very fresh , and frightfully hungry , so I must certainly be gaining strength . Your letter to - day is very prettily written so you are certainly not losing it . I take some pains with my writing , but am always shocked to look at it afterwards . I had a botanist breakfasting with me to - day who wrote a most beautiful hand - but he was one lump of pleasant active egotism - utterly insensitive , and I fancy my broken hand comes partly of sensitiveness , which I should be sorry to loose . I enclose August cheque - with love - You must put your name on the back .
