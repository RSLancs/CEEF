I had a delightful walk with Mary Kerr up Rhymer 's glen yesterday - anything more entirely after Scott's mind could'nt be - the little brook among the rocks , and winding path , and Melrose tower seen down the valley , and a very perfectly beautiful Catholic girl - of old family , for one 's guide - tete e tete . Afterwards , ( I complaining that my walk had been too short ) she took me round by Chiefswood cottage , Lockhart's old house ( where Miss Lockhart was born ) which is still a lovely place , and prettily kept by its tenant . I was sorry to some away , but I want to put myself into regular course of training which when one is staying at anybody 's house , is impossible . So I 've come here . The Old Royal Oak is now only a commercial inn . The great Keswick Inn is at the railroad station . I have come farther on , towards Bassenthwaite abd have got quiet rooms , where I shall certainly stay a few days It is finer this morning , and I want to get out , so will be short .
