I expect your letter every minute , but have litte to tell you in answer , except that the walks here are very beautiful , and that though I went early to bed , I was so sound asleep at seven o'clock that Crawley had to knock five times - each louder that before , which as Ann will tell you is a different state of things from my sleeping at home . But I an doing no work and am in the air all day . I have just got your two sweet letters , which though you say must accustom yourself more to writing , are the most legible I have to - day received - Entirely legible thoughout . About the house cleaning , I am afraid you need not hurry it , for I think , if I begin really to gain strength here , I ought to stay some time and so all I can to lay in store of health for the winter . I have hardly yet begun to get ant excercise - yesterday was the first day I could really walk with any pleasure and I an sadly stiff and weak - and clearly in absolute need of some persistance in the process , though I think of you at home very sorrowfully - but I can not venture to lead sedentary life again yet for a while . I hope to send you a larger letter on Monday . Perhaps Miss Fall would kindly read you the enclosed about Miss Ironside . It may be of interest to you . Your envelope was beautifully directed , better than mine , but here is one for you . I forgot to say I told Connie thay sometimes if on a fine afternoon , she liked without coming into the house to bring her companions for thier afternoon walk round the garden , and have a talk with Downes , it would not disturb you , and would be a great privilege to them .
