The weather , though varying from windy and cold , to thundery and hot , allows me to get out nearly all day long , and I have no doubt that I gain more than I feel , - one can not set a complete reaction of the system on foot in a week . I met one of Acland's friends a Mr. Butler , the brother of the head master of Harrow , on the lake yesterday : he was being rowed by the " Lord of the Isles , " the gentlemen who lives in the house on the island : and they wanted me to go and see them in their Atlantic : I would not : but promised when I came back , which I really mean to do , to report myself at the island - it will on the whole be more good than harm that I should know some of the people living here : and besides , I can not help it but by mere savagery . I have just got your long and quite legible letter of yesterday enclosing Mr. Richmond's , very nice . I will take care about lake air & c in evening , but there is a sort of instinct in everybody in health , to get upon the water in the evening , which has been the same in all ages . There is more marsh about these lakes than there ought to be however , and I will take care .
