I hope this will reach you to - morrow morning : we take extra penny 's worth of precaution that it may . - I got to Newton - Stewart quite comfortably yesterday and found Joan and Kate waiting , and the country all the way from Dumfries was much more beautiful than I expected , and Newton Stewart also , and this little house is as comfortable as can be , and my room immensely nice - and it is really very good for me to be for a little while without Crawley . I was getting so dreamy , I could not in the least take care of myself - I mean to return to Keswick on Monday , - please tell any of the servants to tell Crawley if he picks up his things at Carlisle and comes to the Derwentwater here on Monday evening it will be all right . I am quite well and getting stronger . - I must be short to - day to catch post . Joanna's & everybody 's love . Mary is much improved and Kate 's expression very sweet
