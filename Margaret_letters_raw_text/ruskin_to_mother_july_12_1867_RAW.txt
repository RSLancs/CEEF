It is a fine morning and Joanna is very well and in high spirits about Percy's birthday , and we are going in the afternoon to see Glenluce , as you wished . ( thanks for nice and beautifully written letter received yesterday ) . We drove yesterday to Garlieston , and called on three old ladies , " Miss McLanes" - living with their brother in a pretty house by the seaside - it was all so intensely like a scene in Sir Walter Scott . They were real ladies , and it was very sweet and nice . I had a quiet evening of rest , Joanna playing and singing very nicely . I am much pleased to see her in such bright health I have enclosed an envelope for Keswick as I am not quite sure if your Saturday 's letter would arrive on Sunday here . But it is safe at the old Royal Oak , where I am going for old times ' sake , and if I find it now altered and uncomfortable I shall go on to Wast - water on some other place where I can have pure air and climbing , for I mean to make the most I can of the time I take from you .
