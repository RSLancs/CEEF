I discovered too late yesterday that there was no post on Sunday , so I could only send telegram . You will get this , and I hope another from Carlisle , on Tuesday morning . I went to Glen Luce on friday afternoon - it is much prettier than Wigtown , the ruins of the abbey are still very beautiful - but the manse , alas , had been pulled down , and rebuilt in the vulgar Scotch way . The river and valley , and banks of wood sloping down , with wild rose and wild pinks , were all as lovely as could be . But the provincial towns are more and more reduced and absorbed by the capital ones , and every country town I have passed through in Cumberland , Yorkshire , and Scotland , has the same aspect of deep melancholy and ruin . I am writing carelessly this morning for I am a little despondent at the sight of these old places , and I 'm sorry to leave Joanna and her sisters , for I know that my being here must be a great pleasure to them , - but this place is too far from either hills or sea to be any good to me , so I must go back to Cumberland . I hope to send a more cheerful letter with this . I have yours , I fear a little nervious about Crawley's home coming .
