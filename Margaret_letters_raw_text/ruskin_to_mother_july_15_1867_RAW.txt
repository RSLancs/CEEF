Their posts are so awkward here that I am pretty sure to miss the one at Carlisle , so this is to enclose your to - morrow 's envelope and to say , I called on Miss McAdam Mrs. Young's niece yesterday , and was much pleased by her gentle face and beautiful manner . The Scottish real ladies of the middle classes of England , or perhaps more accurately , the Scottish aristocracy is a much larger body than the English , though the greater part of it untitles . The evergreens in her garden were planted by Mrs. Youngs and are now beautiful - not having suffered at all by last spring 's frost . I called also in my old uncle Tweeddale's house , on Lane - I am pleased with Arbuthnot who is to marry Kate : and very much pleased indeed with his family , especially his sister and her husband . I hear excellent accounts of the one who has engaged Mary . The Procurator Fiscal of Dumfries must be a very good position . Mary herself is a far nicer and more intelligent girl than I supposed . Kate is very good too , and much improved happiness . I have been quite comfortable without Crawley , but must go now to Keswick to get put to rights in portmanteau
