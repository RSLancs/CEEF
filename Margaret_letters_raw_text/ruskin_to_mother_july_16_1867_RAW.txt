I was detained by weather yesterday , but am really off this morning , and hope to send you telegram from Keswick to - morrow , as soon , almost , as you can get this . I have given great pleasure by coming here , and I know several conditions of things respecting the family which enabled me to judge more clearly in what regards Percy . That was what I mainly came for I think more highly of Joanna and her sister than I did , nor am I disappointed in thier way of life - as compared with all around them : but there is much to depress me in the aspect of Scotland and in the desertion of these provincial towns - and I have the secret of extracting sadness from all things - instead of joys which is no enviable talisman . Forgive me if I ever write in a way that may pain you - It is best that you should know when I write cheerfully it is no pretended cheerfulness - so when I am sad - I think it right to confess it .
