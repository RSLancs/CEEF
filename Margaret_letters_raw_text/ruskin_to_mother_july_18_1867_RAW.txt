I must only write a line to - day for the rain rained all day yesterday and it has only just cleared and I must go out . And I ca n't write in the evening . It sets me thinking and puts me off sleep . I try merely to digest in the evening . Forgive this line . I have your beautiful letter of yesterday . I need not have hurried for there is the rain on again , - but I have had several other letters to answer , and am put out , and not able to write - for - what do you think - Sir Walter Trevelyan is just going to marry again ! - a Miss Lofft .
