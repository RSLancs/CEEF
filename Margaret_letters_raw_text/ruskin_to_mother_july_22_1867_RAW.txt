I was calling to - day on the Mr and Mrs. Butler of Oxford , who lost their little daughter by her falling downstairs ( over the bannisters - she is a very sweet and nice person . I imagine it washe who must have taught the child to climb over the bannisters . They are staying at the house on the island , Mr. Marshalls , which is a very fine piece of like gardening and building . Mr Marshall himself very like John Lewis but seems nicer . Afterwards , as it was raining and blowing hard , I could'nt row , so I climbing Wallacrag and found that I 'm getting my limbs again gradually . And that 's all I can write to - day , for I was kept later by the rain , in reaching home . I 've written a line to Kate on her marriage - It 's very hard having to congratulate everybody and never being married myself .
