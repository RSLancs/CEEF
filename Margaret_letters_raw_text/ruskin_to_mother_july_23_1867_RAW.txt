I have your nice letter saying you were so much interested by the account of the apprentice of the river : I will get the Times and look at it I see no papers here , on purpose . They disturb my peace of mind mightily - and I 'm trying to think of nothing at all - but Rose - who is everywhere all day long , quietly . I found a very interesting scene yesterday in a dingle quite hitherto unknown to me , on the left hand side of the lake , and am going over there again to - day - It was pouring rain yesterday , and I had leap three streams , and wade one , where usually there are only little , trickling brooklets , and the Derwent , in which a doggie no bigger than Wisie would hardly have found a pool where he could swim , a week ago , is now a steady , grand , eddying torrent like a main branch of the Tay . - There Cumberland and Scotch streams , at their strongest - are however never like Swiss ones , - for great reasons , they never flow down steep slopes - though often with no more water actually in the bed at one time than in the Cumberland torrent - for going six times the pace , it can deliver six times the quantity of water in the same time , without being any deeper . I hope you will have Joanna with you on Thursday . I shall be so much more comfortable .
