I have your nice line ; but am very sorry you are so nervous . I think this is a thing which can be , and ought to be , avoided . Merely resolving to let the house take care of itself for a fortnight and absolutely not allowing any one to ask you a question- ( and sending Ann , who would be unmanageable under such circumstances , to the seaside- ) - letting Joanna order dinner , and living- for the fortnight- upstairs- and seeing no one . You would thus recover calm , and confidence in yourself . I am in hopes however that having Joanna at home will make a greatdifference - only she ought to be wanted soon in Ireland , and you know , we must get into the way of sparing her . You must forgive the nonsense I write to her . You will get some good of the letters . and I could n't write at all , if they were to be " serious "
