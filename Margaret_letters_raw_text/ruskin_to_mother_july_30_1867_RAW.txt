Downes arrived yesterday quite comfortably and in fine weather It is not bad this morning , and I hope to take him for a walk up Saddleback , which after all is the finest to my mind , of all the Cumberland hills - though that is not saying much , for they are much lower in effect , in proportion to their real height , than I had expected- The beauty of the country is in its quiet roadside bits , and rusticity of cottage life and shepherd labour . - its mountains are sorrowfully melted away from my old dreams of them . I have your nice line of yesterday- I am so thankful to know that you can still read nicely .. it is only now & then , when you are tired , that I see any failure in the writing . I think that arrangement about not reading Joanna 's letters to me and only mine to her will be quite right . It will leave her quite at ease and unrestrained .
