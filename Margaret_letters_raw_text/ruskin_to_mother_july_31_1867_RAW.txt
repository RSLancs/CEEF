The weather is really very endurable now , and to be commended , for Cumberland : it was shady and clear yesterday , without rain . and I did what I had long had it in mind to do , - went straight up the steep front of Saddleback by the central ridge to the summit . It is the finest thing I 've yet seen , there being several bits of real Crag - work , and a fine view at the top over the great plains of Penrith on one side and the Cumberland hills , as a chain , on the other . Fine fresh wind blowing and plenty of crows . Do you remember poor papa 's favourite story about the Quakers whom the crows ate on Saddleback . There were some of the biggest and hoarsest - voiced ones about the cliff that I 've ever k had sympathetic croaks from- and one on the top , or near it , so big , that Downes and Crawley having Austrian tendences in politics , took it for a " black eagle " Downes went up capitally , though I could n't get him down again , because he would stop to gather ferns . However we did it all and came down to Threlkeld , - of the Bridal of Triermain , " The King his way pursued By Lonely Threlkeld's waste & wood " in good time for me to dress and for a wonder , go out to dinner , with Acland's friends the Butlers , -chiefly to meet a young Scotchman- whom I will tell you about in Joanna 's letter as this is enough for you to read to day
