It is really a settled fine evening at last , of which I am glad , because of Downes - for I see it is generally more or less the same weather everywhere . I am going to take a little carriage half way to Penrith & under Saddleback & look at some rocks I want to see there and pull Downes out of the train when it stops at the Troutbeck station - ( not the Troutbeck you and I used to go to from Bowness ) and to take him down the old mail coach road into Keswick - if the evening is fine , it will be quite lovely . I am very well , though still rather sulky - Love to Tom .
