I have just written the enclosed letter to your old friend MIsabella Mare . I fear it is badly written but you may like to look at it . Then you have only to fasten it and order to be posted . By a stupid mistake of David's and a stupidness of my own I got taken to the wrong station on Friday lost the train and did not get to Greta bridge till eight o'clock instead of four , thereby losing post , so that you have been kept thus long without letters . I got down comfortably however , and instead of my evening walk at Greta bridge , I saw YorK cathedral , ( having to wait there , ) and some picturesque and very clean old streets . Greta bridge is only changed by being duller : no one ever goes there now - the Landlord Mr Moritt , must be an utterly bad one - neglect and filth manifest themselves everywhere through the divine beauty of the country . But the Tees is turned into a mere manufacturer 's drain - pipe . Nor is the Greta any more clear but I saw some lovely streams between Brough and here . This place is in view quite unchanged , but the Inn is rebuilt - and as full of not fasionable - but rich people flaunting about , as the hotel Monnet at Vevay . It is all painful and asddening to me . But I am absolutly in want of fresh air and idleness , and must take them as a nasty medicine , though I would incomparably rather be working amongst the camphor and ambergris of insects and mummies in the British Museum and deciphering wing - scales and hieroglyphs - if I could - or working all day long in my own mineral room . But I can not - and must walk and strive to bannish sad thoughts as best I can . I feel a little bettering in strength , already . The envelope enclosed will I doubt not safely reach me . I am very sorry for your loneliness this Sunday .
